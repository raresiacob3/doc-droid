Steps for starting the project:

Turn ON the battery case in order to turn the batteries on.
Turn ON the Robot.
After waiting 30 seconds for the robot to boot up, it will generate a Wi-fi connection.
Using an app called VNC Viewer, connect the PC to the Raspberry Pi OS by connecting to the robot's Wi-fi.
Once entered in the Raspberry Pi OS, navigate to the folder where we have all the needed files and functionalities:
